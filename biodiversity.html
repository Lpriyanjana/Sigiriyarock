The area features both natural forest cover and cultivated landscapes, offering a diverse array of plant species. Visitors can see tropical hardwood trees such as teak, mahogany, and ebony, along with various species of palms, orchids, and ferns.<br>The diverse habitats around Sigiriya support a wide range of animal species. While the rock fortress itself may not harbor significant wildlife due to its rocky terrain, the surrounding forests and plains are home to numerous mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects.
