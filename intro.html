		<h1> Introduction <br> about <br><span> SIGIRIYA</span></h1>
		<br>
		
		<p class="par1"> Sigiriya is an ancient rock fortress located in the northern matale District near the town of Dambulla in the cetral province, Sri Lanka.It is a site of historical and archaeological significance that is dominated by a massive column of granite approximately 180m high.
	According to the ancient Sri Lankan chronicle the <i>Cūḷavaṃsa</i>, this area was a large forest, then after storms and landslides it became a hill and was selected by King Kashyapa for his new capital. He built his palace on top of this rock and decorated its sides with colourful frescoes. On a small plateau about halfway up the side of this rock he built a gateway in the form of an enormous lion. The name of this place is derived from this structure; <b>Siṃhagiri, the Lion Rock.</b></p>
