	<p>Sigiriya is an ancient rock fortress located in the northern matale District near the town of Dambulla in the cetral province, Sri Lanka.It is a site of historical and archaeological significance that is dominated by a massive column of granite approximately 180m high.
	According to the ancient Sri Lankan chronicle the <i>Cūḷavaṃsa</i>, this area was a large forest, then after storms and landslides it became a hill and was selected by King Kashyapa for his new capital. He built his palace on top of this rock and decorated its sides with colourful frescoes. On a small plateau about halfway up the side of this rock he built a gateway in the form of an enormous lion. The name of this place is derived from this structure; <b>Siṃhagiri, the Lion Rock.</b></p>
	<h2> History of Sigiriya</h2>
	<p>Since the 3rd century BC, Sigiriya was used as a monastery, and after eight centuries, it was turned into a royal palace.<br>
	The construction and early history of the palace and fortress of Sigiriya are connected with several tragic events in the relationship between two royal brothers – Kasyapa and Moggallana. King Kasyapa (477-495 AD) illegally took the throne.he legal heir to the throne, Maggallana, was forced to escape to India.<br><br>Fearing an attack by his brother Kasyapa, he moved the capital from Anuradhapura to the central parts of Sri Lanka. He constructed a royal palace on a high rock to ensure the proper heir would not invade it to the throne, Maggallana.The palace – Sigiriya was constructed using the most advanced technologies of the time and was richly decorated with colorful frescos. After Kasyapa was killed in the battle with his brother’s army, the capital was moved back to Anuradhapura. Maggallana destroyed his brother’s palace, and Sigiriya became a Buddhist monastery again. Approximately a thousand years later – in the 14th century, it was also abandoned by monks.n 1831 Europeans accidentally discovered Sigiriya. Jonathan Forbes, a major in the British army, discovered it on his way from Polonnaruwa, a central Sri Lankan city.</p>
